This is my personal site which shows all information about me. I have also added MySQL to its contact page using PHP.


Note:
A) For MySQL Database on Contact Page -

1. Install Xampp
2. Move project folder to xampp/htdocs
3. Open PHPMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
4. Create a database with name "contact"
5. Import contact.sql file to database created.
